    <!-- 6a. Create a variable called ‘hour’ and save the current hour of the day
(use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).
If hour is between 6 and 12, display ‘Good morning!’ in the console

- If hour is between 13 and 17, display ‘Good afternoon!’ in the console
- If hour is between 18 and 20, display ‘Good evening!’ in the console
- Otherwise, display ‘Good night!’ in the console

6b. Continuing from 6a, try changing the value in the ‘hour’ variable to
make it display different messages.

6c. Continuing from 6a, create a variable called ‘name’ and save your
name inside (as a string). Update the if-statement to display your
name in each message. For example: ‘Good morning ${name}"

6d. Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years
and younger) or seniors (65 years and older) .
« Create a variable ‘age’ and save a person's age inside.
« Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a
discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise,
display 'No discount' in the console.
Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.

- Try changing the ‘age’ variable to display different messages.

6e. Continuing from exercise 6d, let's say the discount is only available
if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
« Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must
meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
« Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use
brackets () to control which code gets done first.
« Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.

We'll create a coin-flip game (create 1 HTML file for exercises 6f - 6j):
6f. Generate a random number with Math.random(). Save it in a variable.

6g. Create an if-statement and check:

- If the number is less than 0.5, then display ‘heads’ in the console.
- Else display ‘tails’ in the console.

6h. Instead of displaying ‘heads’ or ‘tails’ in the console, save the result
in a variable called ‘result’.

6i. Let's say we're trying to guess the result. Create a variable called
‘guess’ and save your guess (‘heads’ or ‘tails’). |

- If your guess matches the result, display ‘You win!" in the console
- If your guess does not match the result, display ‘You lose!

6j. (Challenge) Instead of using if-statements in the previous exercises,
try switching them into ternary operators (condition ? A: B).

Challenge Exercises
Setup: we'll improve the Cart Quantity project. First, make a copy of the
project from exercise 5k (if you didn’t do 5k, check the solutions).
