    <!-- Lesson 5 Exercises - Variables

Note: to do these exercises, create an HTML file (like 5a.html, 5b.html, ...)

5a. Create a `<script>` element. Inside the `<script>`, create a variable
called ‘name’, and save your name in this variable (as a string).

5b. Continuing from 5a, display the message ‘My name is: ${name}’ in the
console (insert the ‘name’ variable created in 5a into this message).

5c. At a restaurant, you order 1 coffee (₹5), 2 Samosa (₹15 each), and 1 Kachori
(₹10). Calculate the cost and save it in a variable called ‘cost’.

5d. Continuing from 5c, display `Cost of food: $${cost}` in the console.

5e. Let's say the restaurant charges a 10% tax. Using the ‘cost’ variable
from 5c, calculate the tax (hint: multiply by 0.1), and save the result
in a variable.

5f. Continuing from 5e, display `Tax (10%): $${tax}` in the console.

5g. Continuing from 5f, calculate the total (cost + tax), save it in a variable
called ‘totalCost’, and display the message `Total cost: $${totalCost}’
in the console.

<script>
    // 5a
    let name = "Jaibhim Bangrey"
    //5b
    console.log(`My name is: ${name}`)
    //5c
    let cost = (1*5 )+ (2 * 15) + 10 =45;
    //5d
    console.log(`Cost of food: ${cost}`)
    //5e
    let tax = cost * 0.1 = 4.5;
    //5f
    console.log(`Tax (10%): ${tax}`)
    //5g
    let totalCost = cost + tax
    console.log(`Total cost: ${totalCost}`)
